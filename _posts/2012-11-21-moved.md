No, this is not the typical I have ditched (insert CMS here) for Jekyll post.

I just realized that I really don't need my own web hosting account and it's just additional monthly expense.

I will probably get a new web hosting account once I have a web site that demands it.

For now, I'm using [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com)  for [Myhedspace](http://myhedspace.com)  and [GitHub](http://github.com)  for this [site](http://jelontok.com).
