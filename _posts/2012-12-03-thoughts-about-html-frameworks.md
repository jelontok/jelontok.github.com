title: Thoughts about HTML frameworks
---

<p class="date">December 3, 2012</p>

I'm not a big fan of HTML frameworks. For me they are bloated and come with lot of stuff that your projects don't need.

Lately, we've getting a lot of inquiries regarding markup work with a required HTML framework to be used. We're lucky that our developers
are very flexible and willing to adapt to HTML frameworks.

I guess it's my time adapt too..

Here is a list of HTML frameworks that I've actually been following for years but I haven't have the time to try out.

* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)
* [960gs](http://960.gs/)
* [Blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/)

There are also lots of great HTML frameworks found in [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=HTML+Frameworks).

If I'm finally going to dive in the framework bandwagon, the features I'm looking for are listed below:

* CSS reset
* Nice base typography
* **Small footprint**

I'm still not a fan of HTML frameworks but I guess it's time for me to follow this cliche -> "Why reinvent the wheel?"
