title: Kahon theme for Tumblr
---

<p class="date">December 5, 2012</p>

I got bored one night and I played around Tumblr's custom themes. I created a theme "Kahon" which means "box"
in Tagalog. The theme is ideal for a Portfolio or Gallery type tumblog.

I submitted it to the [Tumblr Theme Garden](http://www.tumblr.com/themes/) but it was not accepted.

Tumblr allows non accepted theme to be previewed and installed but the developer must share the link to theme's page because it will
not appear on the theme garden page.

Kahon is located [here](http://www.tumblr.com/theme/36590).

I was trying to update the theme's code but it looks like it's being updated.

The up to date theme code is in my [github account](https://github.com/jelontok/kahon).
